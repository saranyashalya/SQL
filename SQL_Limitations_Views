

1. You cannot pass parameters to a view. Table Valued functions are an excellent replacement for parameterized views.

create function fn_withparameters (@Gender nvarchar(10))
Returns Table
as
Return(Select Id, Name, Gender from tblEmployee
where Gender = @Gender)

select * from fn_withparameters('Female')

Id	Name	Gender
3	Pam	Female
5	Sara	Female

2. Rules and Defaults cannot be associated with views.

3. The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.
Create View vWEmployeeDetailsSorted
as
Select Id, Name, Gender, DepartmentId
from tblEmployee
order by Id
If you use ORDER BY, you will get an error stating - 
'The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.'


4.Views cannot be based on temporary tables.

Create Table ##TestTempTable(Id int, Name nvarchar(20), Gender nvarchar(10))

Insert into ##TestTempTable values(101, 'Martin', 'Male')
Insert into ##TestTempTable values(102, 'Joe', 'Female')
Insert into ##TestTempTable values(103, 'Pam', 'Female')
Insert into ##TestTempTable values(104, 'James', 'Male')

-- Error: Cannot create a view on Temp Tables
Create View vwOnTempTable
as
Select Id, Name, Gender
from ##TestTempTable
