
#What is a View?
A view is nothing more than a saved SQL query. A view can also be considered as a virtual table. 


create view VWEmployeesByDepartment
as
  select Id, Name, Salary, Gender, DeptName
  from tblEmployee
  inner join
  tblDepartment
  on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId

select * from VWEmployeesByDepartment

o/p
Id	Name	Salary	Gender	DeptName
1	John	5000	Male	HR
2	Mike	3400	Male	Payroll
3	Pam	6000	Female	IT
4	Todd	4800	Male	Admin
5	Sara	3200	Female	IT
6	Ben	4800	Male	HR

Advantages of views:

1.Views can be used to reduce the complexity of the database schema, for non IT users. 
The sample view, vWEmployeesByDepartment, hides the complexity of joins. 
Non-IT users, finds it easy to query the view, rather than writing complex joins.

2. Security reasons
##Row level security

#Granting access only to the view to the users who want to view only IT employee details, we can restrict access through views 

Alter view VWEmployeesByDepartment
as
  select Id, Name, Salary, Gender, DeptName
  from tblEmployee
  inner join
  tblDepartment
  on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
  where tblDepartment.DeptName ='IT'

select * from VWEmployeesByDepartment;

Id	Name	Salary	Gender	DeptName
3	Pam	6000	Female	IT
5	Sara	3200	Female	IT


## Column level security

create view VWEmployeesByDepartmentnonconfidential
as
  select Id, Name,  Gender, DeptName
  from tblEmployee
  inner join
  tblDepartment
  on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId


select * from VWEmployeesByDepartmentnonconfidential;

Id	Name	Gender	DeptName
1	John	Male	HR
2	Mike	Male	Payroll
3	Pam	Female	IT
4	Todd	Male	Admin
5	Sara	Female	IT
6	Ben	Male	HR


3. summarizing the output
create view VWEmployeesByDepartmentcount
as
  select DeptName, count(Id) as TotalEmployees
  from tblEmployee
  inner join
  tblDepartment
  on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
  group by tblDepartment.DeptName

select * from VWEmployeesByDepartmentcount

DeptName	TotalEmployees
Admin	1
HR		2
IT		2
Payroll	1

##updateable views

update VWEmployeesByDepartmentnonconfidential
set Name ='Sara' where Id =1

Id	Name	Gender	DeptName
1	Sara	Male	HR
2	Mike	Male	Payroll
3	Pam	Female	IT
4	Todd	Male	Admin
5	Sara	Female	IT
6	Ben	Male	HR

##updateable views has changed the table data
select * from tblEmployee
o/p
Id	Name	Salary	Gender	DepartmentId
1	Sara	5000	Male	3
2	Mike	3400	Male	2
3	Pam	6000	Female	1
4	Todd	4800	Male	4
5	Sara	3200	Female	1
6	Ben	4800	Male	3

The UPDATE statement, updated DeptName from HR to IT in tblDepartment table, instead of updating DepartmentId column in tblEmployee table. 
So, the conclusion - If a view is based on multiple tables, and if you update the view, it may not update the underlying base tables correctly. 
To correctly update a view, that is based on multiple table, INSTEAD OF triggers are used.
