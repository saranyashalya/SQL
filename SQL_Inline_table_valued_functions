##Inline table-valued functions


Create function TableByGender(@Gen nvarchar(10))
returns table
as
return(select Name, Gender from tblEmployee where Gender = @Gen)


Select * from TableByGender('Male')
o/p:
Name	Gender
Tom	 	Male
John	Male
Sam		Male
Todd	Male
Ben		Male
James	Male
Russell	Male

If you look at the way we implemented this function, it is very similar to SCALAR function, with the following differences
1. We specify TABLE as the return type, instead of any scalar data type
2. The function body is not enclosed between BEGIN and END block. Inline table valued function body, cannot have BEGIN and END block.
3. The structure of the table that gets returned, is determined by the SELECT statement with in the function.

Where can we use Inline Table Valued functions
1. Inline Table Valued functions can be used to achieve the functionality of parameterized views. We will talk about views, in a later session.
2. The table returned by the table valued function, can also be used in joins with other tables.

Select TableByGender.Id ,Name, Gender,DepartmentName from TableByGender('Male')
inner join
tblDepartment on
TableByGender.Id = tblDepartment.Id

Id	Name	Gender	DepartmentName
1	Tom	Male	IT
3	John	Male	HR
4	Sam	Male	Other Department


#Using Inline table functions we can update the table but not using multiline table functions.

Select * from TableByGender('Male')

Update TableByGender('Male') set Name='Tommy' where Id=1
