Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = Primary key(id) - 10000
ii. Hours = Foreign key(business_id) - 1562
iii. Category = Foreign key(business_id) -2643
iv. Attribute = Foreign key(business_id) - 1115
v. Review = Foreign key(business_id) - 8090, Foreign key(user_id) - 9581, Primary key (id) = 10000
vi. Checkin = Foreign key(business_id) - 493
vii. Photo = Foreign key(business_id) - 6493
viii. Tip = Foreign key(business_id) - 3979, Foreign key(user_id) - 537
ix. User = Primary key(id) -10000
x. Friend = Foreign key(user_id) - 11
xi. Elite_years = Foreign key(user_id) - 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	Out of top 10 users with highest fans count, I could see medium relationship between having high fans count and useful or funny. 
	Almost 50% of fans count are with useful and funny as compared to the original fans count.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	select stars, count(stars), name from business join category
	on business.id = category.business_id
	where city = 'Toronto' and category ='Food'
	group by stars, name

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	No, it is same.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    Analysis on review text between two business.     
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
       Review text and business data from the business and review table is used  for the analysis on the review text                    
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

| My first visit I specifically requested Dr. Woodson herself after reading a lot of neutral to negative reviews for her PA and NP. After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I've known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn't have found on my own online was the prescriptions. |                           |

| As another reviewer noted, they tend to prescribe the newest brand name drugs and of course both of mine were brand name and expensive! Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they'd requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I'd wasted two hours of my time and another doctor's bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                           |

| Only one lady at the front desk was very friendly; everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there. They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you're not on vacation when they send the bill!                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                           |

| The last in the chain of events to make me move on to a new doctor was when I called to reschedule my third appointment and was put on hold for 7 minutes and then was greeted by a bored sounding woman who barely apologized for the wait. Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I'd successfully broken up with my doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                           |

| Nothing this office did was horrible, but nothing they did was great either. The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn't want to deal with it anymore. There's plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn't that interested in improving their business- so I'll just take mine elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                           |
