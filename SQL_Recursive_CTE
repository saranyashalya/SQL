  select e.Name, isnull(m.Name ,'Super Boss') as 'Manager Name'
  from tblemp e left join tblemp m
  on m.EmployeeId = e.ManagerId
  
o/p
Name	Manager Name
Mike	Todd
Rob	Mike
Todd	Super Boss
Ben	Mike
Sam	Mike

##Using recursive CTE
with employeeCTE(EmployeeID, Name, ManagerId, [Level])
as
(
select EmployeeId, Name, ManagerId, 1
from tblemp where ManagerId is null
union all
select tblemp.employeeid, tblemp.Name, tblemp.ManagerID, employeeCTE.[Level]+1
from tblemp join employeeCTE
on tblemp.ManagerID = employeeCTE.EmployeeID
) 
select EmpCTE.Name as Employee, Isnull(MgrCTE.Name,'Super Boss') as Manager,
EmpCTE.[Level] 
from employeeCTE EmpCTE left join employeeCTE MgrCTE
on EmpCTE.ManagerId = MgrCTE.EmployeeID

o/p:
Employee	Manager	Level
Todd	Super Boss	1
Mike	Todd	2
Rob	Mike	3
Ben	Mike	3
Sam	Mike	3

The EmployeesCTE contains 2 queries with UNION ALL operator. The first query selects the EmployeeId, Name, ManagerId, and 1 as the level from tblEmployee where ManagerId is NULL. 
So, here we are giving a LEVEL = 1 for super boss (Whose Manager Id is NULL). 
In the second query, we are joining tblEmployee with EmployeesCTE itself, which allows us to loop thru the hierarchy.
Finally to get the reuired output, we are joining EmployeesCTE with itself.
