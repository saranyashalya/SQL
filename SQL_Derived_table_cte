###We will also explore the differences between Views, Table Variable, Local and Global Temp Tables, Derived tables and common table expressions. 
###Now, we want to write a query which would return the following output. The query should return, the Department Name and Total Number of employees, with in the department.
### The departments with greatar than or equal to 2 employee should only be returned.

##Using view
 Create view vW_empcount
 as
 select DeptName, DeptId , count(*) as totalemp 
 from tblEmployee join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName, DeptId


select DeptName, totalemp from vW_empcount where totalemp >=2
o/p
DeptName	totalemp
IT	3
HR	2

##Using temporary table
select DeptName, DeptId, count(*) as totalemp 
into #tempempcounttbl
from tblEmployee join tblDepartment
on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
group by DeptName, DeptId

select DeptName, totalemp from #tempempcounttbl where totalemp >=2 
o/p
DeptName	totalemp
IT	3
HR	2

##Using table variable
Declare @tblempcount TABLE
(DeptName nvarchar(20), DeptId int, totalemp int)
go

insert into @tblempcount(DeptName, DeptId, totalemp)
 select DeptName, DeptId , count(*) as totalemp 
 from tblEmployee join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName, DeptId;
o/p
DeptName	totalemp
IT	3
HR	2

##using derived table
 select DeptName, totalemp from
 ( select DeptName, DeptId , count(*) as totalemp 
 from tblEmployee join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName, DeptId ) as tblempcount where totalemp >=2

o/p
DeptName	totalemp
IT	3
HR	2

#CTE - Common Table Expressions
With EmployeeCount
(DeptName, DeptId, totalemp)
as
(
 select DeptName, DeptId , count(*) as totalemp 
 from tblEmployee join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName, DeptId
)
Select DeptName, totalemp
from EmployeeCount
where totalemp >= 2

o/p
DeptName	totalemp
IT	3
HR	2
