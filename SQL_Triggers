
In SQL server there are 3 types of triggers
1. DML triggers 
2. DDL triggers
3. Logon trigger

In general, a trigger is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes when an event occurs in the database server.

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements are DML statements. DML triggers are fired, when ever data is modified using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events.

DML triggers can be again classified into 2 types.
1. After triggers (Sometimes called as FOR triggers)
2. Instead of triggers

# created trigger on insert records on tblEmployees table
create trigger tr_tblEmployees_ForInsert
on tblEmployees
FOR insert
as
begin
declare @Id int
select @Id = Id from inserted
insert into tblEmployeeAudit
values ('New emp id '+ CAST(@Id as varchar(3)) + ' inserted at '  + CAST(Getdate() as nvarchar(20)))
end

Insert into tblEmployees values (6,'Tan', '2001-10-01 11:00:00', 'Female', 3, 'Yes')

select * from tblEmployeeAudit
o/p
Id	AuditData
1	New emp id 6 inserted at Jun 20 2019 11:56AM

In the trigger, we are getting the id from inserted table. So, what is this inserted table? INSERTED table, is a special table used by DML triggers. 
When you add a new row into tblEmployee table, a copy of the row will also be made into inserted table, which only a trigger can access. 
You cannot access this table outside the context of the trigger. 
The structure of the inserted table will be identical to the structure of tblEmployee table.

## After / for delete trigger 
create trigger tr_tblEmployees_fordelete
on tblEmployees
for delete
as
begin
declare @id int
select @id = Id from deleted
insert into tblEmployeeAudit
values ('Emp Id ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(5)) + ' deleted at ' + cast(GetDate() as nvarchar(20)))
end

delete from tblEmployees where Id=6

select * from tblEmployeeAudit
o/p
Id	AuditData
1	New emp id 6 at Jun 20 2019 11:56AM
2	Emp Id 6 deleted at Jun 20 2019 12:01PM


## after upate trigger

create trigger tr_tblemployees_forupdate
on tblEmployees
for update
as
begin
select * from deleted
select * from inserted
end

update tblEmployees set Name ='Tom', Gender ='Male', Scientist ='no' where Id = 5
o/p:
Id	Name	DateOfBirth	Gender	DepartmentId	Scientist
5	Sara	1978-11-29 12:59:30.670	Female	1	Yes       

Id	Name	DateOfBirth	Gender	DepartmentId	Scientist
5	Tom	1978-11-29 12:59:30.670	Male	1	no        

## after update trigger and record the old and new values in audit table.
Alter trigger tr_tblemployees_forupdate
on tblEmployees
for update
as
begin
Declare @Id int, @OldName nvarchar(10), @NewName nvarchar(10),
@OldGender nvarchar(10), @NewGender nvarchar(10),
@OldScientist nvarchar(5), @NewScientist nvarchar(5)

Declare @auditstring nvarchar(1000)

select * into #temptable from inserted

while(exists(select Id from #temptable))
	begin
		set @auditstring=''
		select Top(1) @Id =Id, @NewName = Name, @NewGender = Gender, @NewScientist = Scientist from #temptable

		select @OldName = Name, @OldGender = Gender, @OldScientist = Scientist from deleted where Id = @Id

		set @auditstring = 'Employee Id ' + cast(@Id as nvarchar(3)) + ' changed'

		if(@OldName <> @NewName)
			set @auditstring = @auditstring + ' Name changed from ' + cast(@OldName as nvarchar(10)) + ' into ' + cast(@NewName as nvarchar(10))

		if(@OldGender <> @NewGender)
			set @auditstring = @auditstring + ' Gender changed from ' + cast(@OldGender as nvarchar(10)) + ' into ' + cast(@NewGender as nvarchar(10))

		if(@OldScientist <> @NewScientist)
			set @auditstring = @auditstring + ' Scientist change from ' + cast(@OldScientist as nvarchar(5)) + ' into ' + cast(@NewScientist as nvarchar(5))


		insert into tblEmployeeAudit values(@auditstring)

		Delete from #temptable where Id = @Id
	end

end

update tblEmployees set Name ='Tanya', Gender ='Female', Scientist ='Yes' where Id = 5

select * from tblEmployeeAudit
o/p
Id	AuditData
1	New emp id 6 at Jun 20 2019 11:56AM
2	Emp Id 6 deleted at Jun 20 2019 12:01PM
3	Employee Id 5 changed Name changed from Tom into Tanya Gender changed from Male into Female Scientist change from no    into Yes
