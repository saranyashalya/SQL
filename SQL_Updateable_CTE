o/p:
Msg 4405, Level 16, State 1, Line 44
View or function 'cte_multipletable' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.

So in short if, 
1. A CTE is based on a single base table, then the UPDATE suceeds and works as expected.
2. A CTE is based on more than one base table, and if the UPDATE affects multiple base tables, the update is not allowed and the statement terminates with an error.
3. A CTE is based on more than one base table, and if the UPDATE affects only one base table, the UPDATE succeeds(but not as expected always)
