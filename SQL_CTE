( CTE_query )
SQL query using CTE


The CTE column names and CTE query column names can be different. Infact, CTE column names are optional. 
However, if you do specify, the number of CTE columns and the CTE SELECT query columns should be same. 
Otherwise you will get an error stating - 'EmployeeCount has fewer columns than were specified in the column list'. 

##
Remember, a CTE can only be referenced by a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, that immediately follows the CTE. 
If you try to do something else in between, we get an error stating - 'Common table expression defined but not used'. 
The following SQL, raise an error.

With totalempcount(DeptName, totalemp)
as
(select DeptName, count(*) as totalemp
from tblemployee join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName)
  select 'hi'
   select DeptName, totalemp from totalempcount

o/p
Msg 422, Level 16, State 4, Line 30
Common table expression defined but not used.
